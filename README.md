# Python Calendars
As creating a calendar script in Python is almost a rite of passage, I wanted to demonstrate how little (or how high-level) code you can get away with while still having a fully functional calendar application. Some purist developers may outright disapprove of people who can only code in Python for this reason. However, in my opinion, why write something with a lot of code if it can be done with very little? Not everything has to be a math quiz. Therefore, I also decided to create a slightly more complex GUI-based calendar, adding a few extra features to the code. Feel free to use it as the basis for your own project or as inspiration for something else entirely. Have fun!"

### Two Scripts
This repository contains two Python calendar scripts. The first script displays the current month's calendar in the terminal. The second script is a GUI calendar widget with navigation buttons to view the previous and next months.

# Calendar Widget
This is a simple calendar widget implemented in Python using the Tkinter library. It displays the current date and time, along with a greeting based on the time of day. It also provides navigation buttons to view the calendar of the previous and next months.

## Usage
To use this calendar widget, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, the Tkinter library is required, which is usually included with Python installations.

1. Run the script:

   ```shell
   python calendar_widget.py

Once the script is running, a window will appear displaying the calendar widget.

The top section of the window shows the current date and time.
A greeting message is displayed based on the time of day.
The main section of the window displays the calendar for the current month.
Navigation buttons labeled "Previous" and "Next" allow you to move to the calendar of the previous and next months, respectively.

## Dependencies
This script has the following dependencies:

- Python (version 3 or above)
- Tkinter library

If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
