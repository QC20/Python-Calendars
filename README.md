# Python Calendars

This repository contains two Python calendar scripts. The first script displays the current month's calendar in the terminal. The second script is a GUI calendar widget with navigation buttons to view the previous and next months.

As creating a calendar script in Python is almost a rite of passage, I wanted to demonstrate how little (or how high-level) code you can get away with while still having a fully functional calendar application. Some purist developers may outright disapprove of people who can only code in Python for this reason. However, in my opinion, why write something with a lot of code if it can be done with very little? Not everything has to be a math quiz. Therefore, I also decided to create a slightly more complex GUI-based calendar, adding a few extra features to the code. Feel free to use it as the basis for your own project or as inspiration for something else entirely. Have fun!"

## Calendar Widget (complex script)

This is a simple calendar widget implemented in Python using the Tkinter library. It displays the current date and time, along with a greeting based on the time of day. It also provides navigation buttons to view the calendar of the previous and next months.
